Our focus is to generate well being, not manage servers, so we'll leverage the best of managed cloud services. However, we still need to accomodate the security, scalability and other requirements of e-health applications. \n",

You can execute a cell by selecting it and using the \"run\" menu action or shift+enter shortcut. Make sure you execute every cell, as each one defines variables or creates resources for the next. But don't just execute the cell - the whole point of this workshop is undestanding them.\n",
