This is a self paced workshop, just hop in, all you need is:
  * A couple friends: You could do it alone, but what's the fun in that? Grab 2-3 friends and hop in.
  * Your computer. The one that you are reading this is ok.
  * Around 3 hours of undisturbed, dedicated time.
  * A Raspbery Pi. Components and hats you'd like to plug in are welcome!
  * An AWS Account. We'll be frugal but this may incur costs.

If you are attending in person a raspberry pi and an AWS account is provided by the instructors.

## Task 0: Flashing and connecting your Pi [00:05]

If you are attending in person we already did this for you and you can use the information provided with your kit.
